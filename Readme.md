# Set of EDA Analyses

This is a set of EDA Analyses from dataset by Brazilian Government Bid system.
We got the data using the [data retrieve
software](https://github.com/marcoarthur/compras-gov).


# Exploratory data Analysis plan and goals

The general goal is to be able to visualize data to understand government
spending. So visualize which part of Government and who are the beneficiaries
(persons and enterprises) that are serving the government, also which kind of
relation are being developed (auctions, lot, emergency spending, etc...) and of
course to visualize and identify the biggest beneficiaries, so providing some
transparency on the government actions.

The first EDA goals is to show and map institutions and individuals (persons)
that make business with Government, and rank the top of individual as well
institutions that have been doing business with persons (Pessoa FÃ­sica) not
with enterprises.

## Further Analysis

The second steps is try to make an analyses of the type of business is been
doing by observe the textual data declared as the object of this contract, as
well, if possible, other kind of data that could be retrieved from any document
that asserts the business and the contract. We hope also to map information
that could describe location for the service or good that is being traded.
Providing so a map of the business partnership (which government unit).

## Map Goals

Information is better described and showed if provided as map base, so we want
to be able to create thematics maps that would provide the government units
as well as their spending. Also, to be able to localize the persons/enterprises
that had or still have provide services or goods to the government.
